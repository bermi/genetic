# genetic ðŸ§¬

A Typescript Genetic Algorithm Framework based on
[Sean Moriarity's](https://github.com/seanmor5)
[Genetic Algorithms in Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/smgaelixir/genetic-algorithms-in-elixir/)
book.

For details on how genetic algorithms work and their shortcomings, check
[A review on genetic algorithm: past, present, and
future](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-020-10139-6)

This library is asynchronous and its goal is to allow implementing streaming
populations and dynamic fitness functions for continuous evaluation.

## Development

This project has been built using [deno ðŸ¦•](https://deno.land/).

The `Makefile` includes shortcuts to commands that will help you test the
project and run the examples.

## Documentation

Import the main `genetic` async function and type definitions under `Genetic` .

```typescript
import genetic, { Genetic } from "https://deno.land/x/genetic@v1.0.2/mod.ts";
```

State your problem. In this case we'll solve the one max problem (the hello
world of genetic algoritms). Our goal is to maximize the number of ones on a
bitstring.

```typescript
const oneMaxProblem: Genetic.Problem<number> = {
  getGenotype() {
    return new Promise((resolve) =>
      resolve(
        Array.from({ length: 1000 }, () => Math.random() > 0.5 ? 1 : 0),
      )
    );
  },
  fitnessFn(chromosome) {
    return new Promise((resolve) =>
      resolve(chromosome.genes.reduce((total, n) => n + total, 0))
    );
  },
  shouldTerminate: ([best], _generation, _temperature) =>
    best.fitness === maxFitness,
};
```

Specify the options for our genetic algorithm run

```typescript
const options: Genetic.RunOptions<number> = {
  populationSize: 100,
  mutationRate: 0.5,
  selectionRate: 0.8,
  selectionType: "stochasticUniversalSampling",
  coolingRate: 0.85,
};
```

And finally find the best population

```typescript
const bestPopulation = await genetic(
  oneMaxProblem,
  options,
  (message: string) =>
    Deno.stdout.write(new TextEncoder().encode(`\r${message}`)),
);

console.log({ bestPopulation });
```

## Examples

The directory `./examples` contain multiple examples showing how to use this
library.

To run all the examples, call:

```shell
make run-examples
```

## Tests

To run tests call

```shell
make test
```
