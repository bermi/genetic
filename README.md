# genetic ðŸ§¬

[`genetic`](https://github.com/bermi/genetic) is a Typescript Genetic Algorithm
Framework based on [Sean Moriarity's](https://github.com/seanmor5)
[Genetic Algorithms in Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/smgaelixir/genetic-algorithms-in-elixir/)
book.

For details on how genetic algorithms work and their shortcomings, check
[A review on genetic algorithm: past, present, and
future](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-020-10139-6)

This library is asynchronous, and its goal is to allow the implementation of
streaming populations and dynamic fitness functions for continuous evaluation.

Keep in mind that genetic algorithms will underperform
[carefully designed algorithms](https://www.algorist.com/algorist.html) under
most circumstances. They can be helpful for sporadic exploration when the
problem is poorly understood or of stochastic nature.

### Initialization options

* `populationSize`:  Initial population size. Defaults to `100`

### Selection

* `selectionRate`: Rate for selecting fittest parents that will procreate in the crossover process. Default: `0.8`
* `selectionType`: One of the following selection strategies:
  * (default) `elite`: Only the best individuals from the last generation will be carried over (without any changes) to the next one.
  * `random`
  * `tournament`: Randomly divides the population in 3 groups and the winners of each group are carried over.
  * `roulette`: [Fitness proportionate selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection)
  * `stochasticUniversalSampling`
  * `boltzmannSelection`: Temperature controls the rate of selection avoiding premature convergence.
  * `rank`: Selection probabilities based on their rank position. `n + 1/fitnessSum`.

### Crossover

* `crossoverRepairFn`: Optional function for repairing damaged chromosomes.
* `crossoverType`: One of the following crossover strategies:
  * (default) `singlePoint`
  * `orderOne`
  * `uniform`
    * `crossoverRate`
  * `wholeArithmetic`
    * `crossoverAlpha`
  * `partiallyMatched`

### Mutation

* `mutationRate`: Rate of chromosomes that will be mutated. Default: `0.05`
* `mutationFn`: Custom mutation function.
* `mutationType`: One of the following mutation strategies:
  * (default) `shuffle`
  * `flipAll`
  * `flipSome`
    * `genMutationRate`: 0.5
  * `scramble`
  * `scrambleSlice`
    * `scrambleSize`: Default `chromosome.size/2`
  * `gaussian`
    * `genMutationRate`: Default 1

### Reinsertion

* `reinsertionFn`: Custom reinsertion function.
* `reinsertionType`: One of the following reinsertion strategies:
  * `pure`: Default
  * elitist
    * `survivalRate`: Number of survivors to keep on the population. Default: `0.2`
    * `survivorCount`: Absolute number of survivors to keep. Overrides `survivalRate`

### Simulated annealing

* `coolingRate`: Rate at which the temperature will change relative to fitness changes. Defaults to `0.85`

### Evolution options

* `fitnessSortDirection`: Default: `"DESC"`
* `maxPopulation`: Limit how large the population can become after reinsertion. Default `Infinity`
* `maxPopulationFn`: Dynamically limit the population size.


### Usage

Import the main `genetic` async function and type definitions under `Genetic` .

```typescript
import genetic, { Genetic } from "https://deno.land/x/genetic@v1.0.4/mod.ts";
```

State your problem by implementing the [`Problem interface`](https://github.com/bermi/genetic/blob/92649a8b9724b780e74ebfc34d9229f95a1402c2/types.ts#L180). In this case we'll solve the one max problem (the hello
world of genetic algoritms). Our goal is to maximize the number of ones on a
bitstring.

```typescript
const oneMaxProblem: Genetic.Problem<number> = {
  getGenotype() {
    return new Promise((resolve) =>
      resolve(
        Array.from({ length: 1000 }, () => Math.random() > 0.5 ? 1 : 0),
      )
    );
  },
  fitnessFn(chromosome) {
    return new Promise((resolve) =>
      resolve(chromosome.genes.reduce((total, n) => n + total, 0))
    );
  },
  shouldTerminate: ([best], _generation, _temperature) => best.fitness === 1000,
};
```

Specify the options for our genetic algorithm run

```typescript
const options: Genetic.RunOptions<number> = {
  populationSize: 100,
  mutationRate: 0.5,
  selectionRate: 0.8,
  selectionType: "stochasticUniversalSampling",
  coolingRate: 0.85,
};
```

And finally find the best population

```typescript
const bestPopulation = await genetic(
  oneMaxProblem,
  options,
  (message: string) =>
    Deno.stdout.write(new TextEncoder().encode(`\r${message}`)),
);

console.log({ bestPopulation });
```

## Examples

The directory `./examples` contain multiple examples showing how to use this
library.

To run all the examples, call:

```shell
make run-examples
```

## Development

`genetic` has been developed using [deno ðŸ¦•](https://deno.land/).

The `Makefile` includes shortcuts to commands that will help testing the project
and run the examples.


## Tests

To run the tests, call

```shell
make test
```
